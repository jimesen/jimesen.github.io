                            <img id="store-image" src="images/articlepic.jpg" alt="Articlepic">
                            <p>One of the first things you probably do every morning is look out the window to see what
                                the weather is
                                like. Looking outside and listening to the day’s forecast helps you decide what clothes
                                you will wear
                                and maybe even what you will do throughout the day. If you don’t have school and the
                                weather looks
                                sunny, you might visit the zoo or go on a picnic. A rainy day might make you think about
                                visiting a
                                museum or staying home to read.</p>

                            <p>The weather affects us in many ways. Day-to-day changes in weather can influence how we
                                feel and the way
                                we look at the world. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and blizzards, can
                                disrupt many
                                people’s lives because of the destruction they cause.</p>

                            <p>The term “weather” refers to the temporary conditions of the atmosphere, the layer of air
                                that surrounds
                                the Earth. We usually think of weather in terms of the state of the atmosphere in our
                                own part of the
                                world. But weather works like dropping a pebble in water—the ripples eventually affect
                                water far away
                                from where the pebble was dropped. The same happens with weather around the globe.
                                Weather in your
                                region will eventually affect the weather hundreds or thousands of kilometers away. For
                                example, a
                                snowstorm around Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, might eventually reach Chicago, Illinois,
                                as it moves
                                southeast through the U.S.</p>

                            <p>Weather doesn’t just stay in one place. It moves, and changes from hour to hour or day to
                                day. Over many
                                years, certain conditions become familiar weather in an area. The average weather in a
                                specific region,
                                as well as its variations and extremes over many years, is called climate. For example,
                                the city of Las
                                Vegas in the U.S. state of Nevada is generally dry and hot. Honolulu, the capital of the
                                U.S. state of
                                Hawaii, is also hot, but much more humid and rainy.</p>

                            <p>Climate changes, just like weather. However, climate change can take hundreds or even
                                thousands of years.
                                Today, the Sahara Desert in northern Africa is the largest desert in the world. However,
                                several
                                thousand years ago, the climate in the Sahara was quite different. This “Green Sahara”
                                experienced
                                frequent rainy weather. </p>
