            <p>One of the first things you probably do every morning is look out the window to see what the weather is
                like. Looking outside and listening to the day’s forecast helps you decide what clothes you will wear
                and maybe even what you will do throughout the day. If you don’t have school and the weather looks
                sunny, you might visit the zoo or go on a picnic. A rainy day might make you think about visiting a
                museum or staying home to read.</p>

            <p>The weather affects us in many ways. Day-to-day changes in weather can influence how we feel and the way
                we look at the world. Severe weather, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and blizzards, can disrupt many
                people’s lives because of the destruction they cause.</p>

            <p>The term “weather” refers to the temporary conditions of the atmosphere, the layer of air that surrounds
                the Earth. We usually think of weather in terms of the state of the atmosphere in our own part of the
                world. But weather works like dropping a pebble in water—the ripples eventually affect water far away
                from where the pebble was dropped. The same happens with weather around the globe. Weather in your
                region will eventually affect the weather hundreds or thousands of kilometers away. For example, a
                snowstorm around Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, might eventually reach Chicago, Illinois, as it moves
                southeast through the U.S.</p>

            <p>Weather doesn’t just stay in one place. It moves, and changes from hour to hour or day to day. Over many
                years, certain conditions become familiar weather in an area. The average weather in a specific region,
                as well as its variations and extremes over many years, is called climate. For example, the city of Las
                Vegas in the U.S. state of Nevada is generally dry and hot. Honolulu, the capital of the U.S. state of
                Hawaii, is also hot, but much more humid and rainy.</p>

            <p>Climate changes, just like weather. However, climate change can take hundreds or even thousands of years.
                Today, the Sahara Desert in northern Africa is the largest desert in the world. However, several
                thousand years ago, the climate in the Sahara was quite different. This “Green Sahara” experienced
                frequent rainy weather. </p>
