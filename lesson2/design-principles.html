            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google WebSite</a></h3>
            <p>Fitts's Law defines if something is easier or harder to click on.
                For me, Google is a perfect example because always the preferred options are big targets and the less
                preferred is normally a link rather than as a button.

            <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
            <h3><a href="https://store.google.com/us/category/phones?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Google Store</a></h3>
            <p>I selected this website because we can see that they have applied visual hierarchy to this page, guiding
                the readers where to look.</p>
            <p>It starts showing contrast in the font, showing the price and a big call to action button to "Buy Now",
                then it shows a very huge and nice picture of the device and then a set of images of other devices.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://pricesmart.com/site/cr/en/categories" target="_blank">Pricesmart Costa Rica</a></h3>
            <p>I decided to use this website because it shows a very long list on the menu, and for me, it is acceptable
                in this case because it contains items that are known to the users; users can adjust their search, they
                can skip over all the other content that is not what they are looking for and go straight of the variety
                of products they need.</p>
